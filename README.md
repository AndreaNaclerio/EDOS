# NLP PROJECT
Project of NLP course at Politecnico di Milano
#
The project aimed to train a proper model to generate responses in the dialogue that respect the target emotion, but also sentiment analysis: i.e.
to identify the emotion associated with each utterance in the dialogue. 

EDOS, Emotional Dialogues in Open Subtitles, is the dataset used in this project.  The dataset consists of short conversation passages (of 3 to 5 utterances each), 
each labeled with an emotion.
