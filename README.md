# NLP PROJECT 
EDOS, Emotional Dialogues in Open Subtitles, is the dataset used in this project.  The dataset consists of short conversation passages (of 3 to 5 utterances each), 
each labeled with an emotion.

The task is to train a proper model to generate responses in the dialogue that respect the target emotion, but also sentiment analysis: i.e.
to identify the emotion associated with each utterance in the dialogue.
